      "Rhythm Messengers helped transform what could have been a stuffy boring corporate meeting into an unforgettable experience. They provided a  multi-set custom performance piece for our event.\n\n Their high energy drum breaks got our employees out of their chairs, on their feet, and kept them excited and engaged throughout the day.  Our employees were dancing, involved in the performance, and of course taking pictures and videos to show off how much fun they were having while at “work” all over social media.\n\n Working with the team in the planning stage was a breeze. They were always available whenever we had questions and were able to transform our initial idea into something spectacular. One-third of attendees listed the drum-line as their favorite part of our entire event.  We can’t wait to work with Rhythm Messengers again every year!",

      "We partnered with Tom and his musicians for a 250 person corporate event in Chicagoland.  We are a sales driven company and having hosted this event every year we were really looking to inject a ton of excitement to get our folks excited and proud of the company they represent.  Tom and his amazing group of drummers were the perfect addition to our sales rally.  They were incredibly easy to work with, provided fresh ideas, delivered an insane performance, and were just nice people!  If you are looking to get your crowd up and moving, hire these guys!",
